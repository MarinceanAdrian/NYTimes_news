# Reflection
This personal project was the first serious project-building endeavor after finishing some Udemy courses and building up some small scale applications (like todo lists). The project is built using technologies I've learned via Udemy and my peronal notes deriving from other sources like Youtube or blogs.

I wanted to integrate an API in this React based project and let an unauthenticated user browse through 10 general news and an authenticated user browse through a larger variety of news (from different niches) provided by the NY Times API. The authentication part of the app is build using Firebase Google Auth.

I started the project via ```create-react-app``` boilerplate and then built the component tree and the CSS. Then I've integrated as many React knowledge I could: ```react context```, ```redux```, ```css modules```, ```react router```.
